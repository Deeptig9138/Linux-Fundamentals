# Bash Prompt Description
The bash prompt is a versatile and essential feature of the Linux shell, offering users information about their current session and system state. By default, it provides details such as the **username**, **hostname**, and **current working directory**, and serves as a starting point for typing commands.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Default Prompt Structure
The bash prompt typically looks like this:
```
<username>@<hostname><current working directory>$
```

## Examples
1. Home directory prompt:
   ```
   <username>@<hostname>[~]$
   ```
   The tilde (~) represents the user's home directory.

2. Root user prompt:
   ```
   root@<hostname>[/directory]#
   ```
   When logged in as root, the prompt changes the $ symbol to #.

- Basic unprivileged and root shell prompts:
  - Unprivileged User: $
  - Privileged User: #
 
## üîß Customizing the Bash Prompt
The bash prompt is customizable and can be tailored to display additional information such as:

- IP address
- Date and time
- Exit status of the last command
- Full path of the working directory

## Example:
Customizing the prompt to show the full path and target's IP address:
```
<username>@<hostname>[/full/path][IP Address]$
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Using Special Characters and Variables
The bash prompt can be customized using special characters and variables in the shell‚Äôs configuration file (e.g., .bashrc for Bash). Below are some useful characters:
