# Solaris

## Overview
Solaris is a Unix-based operating system developed by **Sun Microsystems** (later acquired by Oracle Corporation) in the 1990s. Renowned for its **robustness**, **scalability**, and support for **high-end hardware and software systems**, Solaris is widely adopted in enterprise environments for mission-critical applications such as:

- **Database Management**
- **Cloud Computing**
- **Virtualization** (with features like Oracle VM Server for SPARC)

Its **reliability, scalability, and security** make it ideal for handling large-scale data and providing dependable services, particularly in industries such as **banking, finance**, and **government**.

## Key Features
- **High Availability**: Built-in features for fault tolerance and system management.
- **Security**: Includes **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **mandatory access controls**.
- **File System**: Utilizes **Zettabyte File System (ZFS)** for advanced data management.
- **Virtualization**: Integrated hypervisor support for running multiple virtual machines.

## Differences: Solaris vs Linux Distributions
### 1. **Open Source**
   - **Solaris**: Proprietary, closed-source.
   - **Linux**: Open-source.

### 2. **Service Management**
   - **Solaris**: Uses **Service Management Facility (SMF)**.
   - **Linux**: Uses different service managers like **systemd**.

### 3. **Package Management**
   - **Solaris**: Employs **Image Packaging System (IPS)**.
   - **Linux**: Commonly uses **APT** (Debian-based) or **YUM/DNF** (Red Hat-based).

## Key Commands

### System Information
- **Solaris**: `showrev -a`
  - Provides detailed information, including patch level and hardware provider.
- **Linux**: `uname -a`
  - Displays basic system info like kernel name and hostname.

### Package Installation
- **Solaris**: `pkgadd -d <package_name>`
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install <package_name>`

### Permissions Management
- **Solaris**: `find / -perm -4000` (find files with SUID bit)
- **Linux**: `find / -perm 4000`

### NFS Configuration
- **Solaris**: Use `share` and configure in `/etc/dfs/dfstab`.
- **Linux**: Configure `/etc/exports`.

### Process Management
- **Solaris**: `pfiles <process_id>` (list files opened by a process)
- **Linux**: `lsof -c <process_name>`

### Debugging Tools
- **Solaris**: `truss <command>` (trace system calls)
- **Linux**: `strace <command>`
