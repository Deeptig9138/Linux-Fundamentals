## Editing Files with Nano

### 1. Introduction to Nano
**Nano** is a simple text editor that runs directly in the terminal. It is easy to use for beginners and is often the default editor in many Linux systems. 

To create a new file or open an existing one with Nano, use the following command:
```bash
username@htb[/htb]$ nano notes.txt
```

Once the editor opens, you will see the following interface:
```
GNU nano 2.9.3                                    notes.txt
Here we can type everything we want and make our notes.â–“

^G Get Help    ^O Write Out   ^W Where Is    ^K Cut Text    ^J Justify     ^C Cur Pos     M-U Undo
^X Exit        ^R Read File   ^\ Replace     ^U Uncut Text  ^T To Spell    ^_ Go To Line  M-E Redo
Here, you can freely type text. The commands listed at the bottom allow you to perform various actions:

^G: Get Help
^O: Save (Write Out)
^W: Search (Where Is)
^X: Exit
```

### 2. Searching for Text in Nano
To search for text, press CTRL + W. Then, type the word you want to search for, such as "we". Press ENTER to jump to the first occurrence of the word. To find the next occurrence, press CTRL + W again and press ENTER without typing any additional text.

### 3. Saving and Exiting
To save the file, press CTRL + O, then confirm the file name by pressing ENTER. To exit Nano, press CTRL + X.

## Editing Files with Vim

### 1. Introduction to Vim

```
Deeptig12@htb[/htb]$ vim <filename>
```

Once Vim opens, you will see something like this:
